"""
:author: Philipp Ruessmann

Plotting utility to visualize the output of the voronoi code.

Reads files 'vertices.dat' to extract the vertices of the shapefunctions and 'positions.dat' (done in 'read_shapefun' function)

Then creates a simple matplotlib image to show the shapefunctions using the 'plot_shapefun' function.
